This repository contains some PyTorch scripts for learning object detection using Deep Learning.

## Fully Convolutional Neural Network

I learned its basics from slides and notebooks of [Deep Learning course of Master Datascience Paris Saclay/](https://github.com/m2dsupsdlclass/lectures-labs). The original codes are implemented with Keras and I reimplemented them with PyTorch.

## localization

An implementation of YOLO v1 [You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640) and a modification of YOLO v1. The latter uses ResNet-50 as its feature extractor.

### result

*under experiment*
